Robot Framework test automation demo on demoblaze.com.

Automated test case for single-product purchase flow,
as that can be seen as a critical use-case.

Tool used here is Robot Framework Browser library.
The library was chosen based on the appearance of
its capabilities and personal interest in it -
this was a great learning experience and at the
same time showcased at least to me that the library
is capable of handling actions in lazy loading
website with ease.

Purchasing one each of the most expensive item in
each category was done as a fun excercise on top of
the more functional test case. As can be seen in the
comments left behind, this just-for-fun project dug
up issues in existing code and showed how use of
arguments in keywords should be more thought of.

It still buys the most expensive stuff so that's
a definite win.
